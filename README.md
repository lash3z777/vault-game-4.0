Vault Game is an interactive giveaway tool designed for gambling streamers who want to reward their viewers using channel points. Viewers get a chance to win real cash prizes through a variety of mini-games. Here's how it works:

🔹 Step 1 – Pick Action
Start by clicking the Pick Action button. This randomly selects which game the viewer gets to play: Tip, Random Prize Picker, Bonus Generator, Wager, or Vault.

🎁 Get Tip
If the action picked is Get Tip, simply press the Tip button. This will give the viewer a small random cash amount (up to $10) — a quick and fun giveaway.

🔢 Generate Random Number + Pick Prize
If the selected action is Random Prize Picker, first press Generate Random Number. This generates a number automatically. Then, click Pick Prize — the result will be a percentage of the generated number, giving you a randomized prize to award.

💰 Bonus Generator
Perfect for bonus buys. After purchasing a bonus (regardless of win or loss), enter the bonus win result amount into the Bonus Generator.
It calculates a random percentage (5–50%) based on that amount and gives you a prize value. You can use this to give away a portion of your bonus, or just enter the profit directly.

🧾 Wager
If the action chosen is Wager, have your viewer provide the amount they’ve wagered under your code in the past 7 days. Enter that amount in the Wager section, and it will generate a prize based on how much they’ve wagered. Bigger wagers mean higher potential rewards (up to $50).

🔐 Vault Game
This is a fun interactive guessing game.

First, set a secret 5-digit code using the “Set Vault Code” input.

Then, your viewer tries to guess the code using the “Try Vault Code” section.

If they guess wrong, their attempt appears in the Last 5 Vault Attempts list.

Correct digits in the correct position are highlighted in green.

If they guess the full code correctly, they win the jackpot — a random amount between $50 and $100!

Vault Game keeps your stream engaging, fun, and rewarding. Use it during live streams to interact with viewers, boost engagement, and celebrate your community — all with a chance at real prizes.
